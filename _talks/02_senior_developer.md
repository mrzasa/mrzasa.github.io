title: "Who is a Senior Developer"
description: I interviewed several engineers and managers to understand how they perceive seniority in our industry. I summarised the findings in a short talk. As a follow-up, I also moderated a discussion panel about being a senior developer. We discussed traits of a senior developer, career progression and title inflation.
