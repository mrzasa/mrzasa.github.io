# **About Me**


Hi, I am **Maciej**, but friends call me **Maciek** :wave:

I'm a **software engineer** with over decade of experience interested in text processing and distributed systems. I built business applications from scratch, developed big legacy systems (1M+ LOC), extracted services, worked with text processing and created tools for development productivity.
Specialising in Ruby I spend most of the time working with Ruby ecosystem, I contributed to the community in a series of [micro-contributions](/open_source). I'm more than happy though to pick up a technology that is right for the job - in the past I've worked with JavaScript, Java and now I'm learning Golang. I'm always curious to see how the tools I use work, so I often pry into their internals (see what I learnt about [databases](/speaking/database_internals)). This habit helped me develop [debugging](/speaking/debug_like_scientists) as my hidden power.

I am an experienced **technical leader**. During my career I built a team from scratch, coordinated project work, and collaborated with client and stakeholders. Interested in software architecture, I'm happy to design and plan technical initiatives. I'm happy to see that processes and practices that I proposed are introduced by the teams I work in and speedup the work. I helped developers grow, and guided them in their careers. I also conducted over 50 technical interviews for both Backend Developer and Backend Architect roles.

I believe that knowledge should be spread, that's why I **advocate for knowledge sharing**. I [speak](/speaking) at conferences, and meetups and I organise community events ([Ruby User Group](http://rrug.pl), [technical conference](https://craft-it.pl), [Rails Girls workshops](http://railsgirls.com/rzeszow)).
I share my experience [teaching](/teaching) part-time at Rzesz√≥w Technical University - focusing mostly on [agile](/writing#ReadingLists-Agile) approach to project management.
