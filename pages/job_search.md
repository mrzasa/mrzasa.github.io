# Job Search Reading List

I've collected articles (with some occasional video/audio content) that helped in looking for a new job. Highly subjective. It's not that I agree with everything the say, yet I believe it's worth reading/watching.

* Must Reads
	* in 2 parts
		* [haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/)

* CV/Resume
	* By Gergely Orosz
		* [StackOverflow Blogpost](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/11/25/how-to-write-an-effective-developer-resume-advice-from-a-hiring-manager/) short and sweet version
		* [Book](https://thetechresume.com/) the long version (ebook), worth reading IMO, it helped me chainging my mindset about the CV - from writing everything to writing only what matters in a given context (without lying ofc)
* Interviews
	* [rkoutnik.com/articles/Questions-to-ask-your-interviewer.html](https://rkoutnik.com/articles/Questions-to-ask-your-interviewer.html) very good post about finding red flags during interviews, I often use those questions
	* [stackoverflow.blog/2017/04/27/how-to-talk-about-yourself-in-an-interview](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/04/27/how-to-talk-about-yourself-in-an-interview)
	* behavioral  - you'd better come with prepared good stories, everytime you answer "I can't recall any situations like this" you're loosing an opportunity to show your advantages
		* [simpleprogrammer.com/ace-behavioral-interview](https://simpleprogrammer.com/ace-behavioral-interview)
	* system design

		* [System Design Interview - Book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CMF2CQF) - nice textbook for preparations, shows the structure of SD interview, but also a lot of case studies; remember it's a textbook-grade, if you want in-depth details, take https://dataintensive.net/
	* Algorithms
		* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) - problems of different types and levels, sandbox in various languages
		* lectures of prof. Eric Demaine - just awesome, take this example [explaining dynamic programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/resources/lecture-19-dynamic-programming-i-fibonacci-shortest-paths/) (also on [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ5jsbhAv_M))
* Negotiations
	* An excellent post about salary negotiations in 2 parts:

	*
	* [kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) - timeless classic (as many writings of Kalzumeus)
	* [Never Split the Difference](https://www.amazon.pl/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/0062407805) - very interesting book about various negotiation techniques, showing a winning mindset. OFC the book itself is not enough without a training, but it helped in me in changing my perspective
